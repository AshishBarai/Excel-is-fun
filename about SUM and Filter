>SUM,
SUM Function – Explanation

Sum is a function that allows us to sum numbers easily.
We can type in the function actual numbers, but we can also use cell references and sum entire ranges!
Syntax
	The syntax of the function is quite simple:
=SUM(value1,value2,value3...)
value1 – number or cell reference we’d like to sum.  If we use cell reference (for example – the range of cells between B2 to B6), we can select a range and sum it – for example, B2:B6.


>MAX,
MAX Function - Explanation
MAX function is used when we want to find the maximum value within a range of cell.

Syntax:
	The Syntax of the MAX function is as follows:
=MAX(value1, value2, value3,...)
We can insert into the MAX function a range of cells, for example:

=MAX(A1:A4)

>MIN,
MIN function - Explanation
MIN Function is the opposite of MAX function, and it's used when we want to find the minimum value within a range of cells.

Syntax:
	The syntax of the MIN Function is as follows:
=MIN(value1,value2,value3,...)

We can insert into the MIN function a range of cells, for example:

=MIN(A1:A4)

The function above will look within the cells in range A1 to A4, and return the smallest value.


>COUNTA,
COUNTA Function - Explanation
With COUNTA you can count all items in a range with COUNTA, both text and Numbers.
The A stands for 'ALL', this is a contrast to count function which counts only numeric values
Syntax
=COUNTA(value1,[value2],[value3]…)

For value1 we will use a cell range – for example, to count the cells in range A1:D4, we will type:

=COUNTA(A1:A4)

We can use this function to check multiple ranges, by typing additional range in [value2], [value3] etc…
